###### BUILT-IN ITERATION METHODS
## Introduction to Built-In Methods For Iteration

To iterate through (or go through each item) in an array, most beginning programmers learn and use the for loop and that's what we've been doing so far.

*But... get ready for this....* 

**There are many different ways to iterate through an array!**

One way is to use JavaScript's very own built-in methods. Programmers who developed the JavaScript language created functions (just like ones that we've used to turn one data type into another or to return a substring of an array) to limit the amount of code needed to write a for loop. 

There are a lot of reasons why we would use built-in methods over the classic for loop. In this lesson, we'll go over what those are, what the built-in methods actually are and how to use them, and how to discover new methods that can make programming much easier.
